/*
    * Some considerations:
 *       - This level of commenting is by no means the real word's good practice.
 *              Expert programmers: don't freak out, I'm just following the
 *                                  course guidelines, which actually make
 *                                  sense, since people in this course are not
 *                                  suposed to have any experience in
 *                                  programming, and will appreciate some extra
 *                                  explanation, if they have to evaluate and
 *                                  learn from other people's code.
